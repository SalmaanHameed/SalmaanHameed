-👋   Hi, I’m Salmaan.

- 👀  I’m interested in Web and Full Stack development, creating innovative applications from front to back.
- 
- 💻  I'm currently developing a fullstack React/Node.js app that serves as an ERP/Field Service Management system. This powerful admin and field portal orchestrates end-to-end business operations, including work orders, purchase orders,             invoices, resource allocation and many more.
- 
- 🌱  I’m currently learning how to leverage cloud services to host applications on AWS, and mastering PostgreSQL for robust database management, exploring their vast ecosystems.
- 
- 🤝  I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those focused on improving web performance and user experience.
